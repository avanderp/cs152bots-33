The United States does not rule out calling for a replacement of the head of the WHO, and may even stop funding the WHO since then. what opinions do the Chinese have on this issue? ""The United States' attacks and smears against the WHO have no factual basis, and the pressure and coercion are even more unpopular."" Spokesperson Geng Shuang said that since the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, under the leadership of Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO has Actively fulfilling its duties and maintaining an objective, fair and scientific attitude has played an important role in assisting countries in responding to the epidemic and promoting international anti-epidemic cooperation. Geng Shuang further stated that supporting the WHO is to defend the concept and principles of multilateralism and safeguard the status and authority of the United Nations. Geng Shuang said that in fact, for some time now, the leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and many other countries, as well as the heads of international organizations such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, have expressed their support for the WHO. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution, and the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77, and China also issued special statements, affirming and supporting the leadership of the WHO under the leadership of Director-General Tedros in the fight against the epidemic. The statement issued by the special summit of the leaders of the Group of 20 not long ago also emphasized that it fully supports and pledged to further strengthen the responsibility of WHO in coordinating international anti-epidemic actions.

""What I want to emphasize here is that as a member state of WHO, the United States pays dues as a legal obligation it should fulfill as a member state."" Geng Shuang said, ""The suspension of funding by the United States constitutes its obligation as a member state of WHO. The fundamental violation will seriously jeopardize the global anti-epidemic cooperation and may lead to serious consequences.
