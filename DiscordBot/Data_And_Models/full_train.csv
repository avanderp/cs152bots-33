Before going out, spray the fines on the clothes.

"Dr. Niu Guan Hot Spot: Share the personal views on the current multi -angle information of pneumonia in Wuhan: 1. At present, Wuhan pneumonia is already a three -generation or fourth generation infection, and the first -line doctors obviously feel that the toxicity of the virus has weakened.2. The prognosis of this disease is very good, unlike the prognosis of SARS, and the lungs will not fibrosis.Treatment experience is also rich and effective, with few sequelae.3. There are indeed a lot of patients in Wuhan. Many severe illnesses are caused by backlog delay.But the newly infected infection is basically mild.4. Patients with severe illnesses are currently treated with a large amount of oxygen and ECMO. As long as they survive the respiratory distress period, they can basically be saved.5. At present, there are so many deaths in Wuhan because the diagnosis is not treated in time and the insufficient understanding of the virus in the early days will cause doctors to use medicine.Yes, this time the virus is strong but not toxic.6. Wuhan Union's employees are actively treating early in the early stage. There are not many non -invasive people. Most of them are discharged by themselves, that is, a few retirees are heavier, and they have recovered smoothly with non -invasive support.7. The first batch of discharge is about to be on the job.According to the observation, the first generation is the first generation, especially the New Year. Many elderly people have no regular treatment at home, and it is a bit troublesome to drag behind.In the past two days, the Concord's Paper Creation has dropped from the peak of 2000 to the current 200, and the inflection point should be almost the same.Ordinary citizens do proper protection, just go out and go out. Don't panic, it is important to use masks correctly.8. Due to a large number of asymptomatic infections, there may be healthy carrying viruses in the future.Like hepatitis B, A flow.It may not be like SARS.9. A comprehensive and comprehensive treatment plan is: inhibit the virus, improve immunity, control the reaction of excessive inflammation in a timely manner, protect the function of important organs, improve the insufficient oxygen supply, maintain the body's metabolic balance, and grasp the use of ECMO in time.The means are very important, and the three hospitals have this condition.10. The whole society isolated for three 14 days. The proportion of new onset every day. Most of the non -Hubei regions are less than one tenth of the million. The mortality rate is a few thousandths. Many diseases are higher than this!Excessive epidemic prevention of fear is the second self -injury of the disaster!It's time to loosen!Everyone uses a mask correctly, measures the body temperature every day, and pays attention to ventilation and gas everywhere.

Those with asymptomatic infections should be isolated for 14 days. After the expiration of the isolation period, in principle, two continuous specimens of nucleic acid detect negatives can relieve the isolation.If symptoms occur during isolation, the hospital is immediately treated.Asymptomatic infections are found to be found through close contact with personnel screening, clustered epidemic survey, and tracing survey of infectious sources.A small number of asymptomatic infections may develop into a confirmed case, but most of them will heal themselves.Asymptomatic infection can also become a source of infection and have a certain risk of communication.At present, the treatment of asymptomatic infected people is to find out isolation. During the isolation, nucleic acid testing and further observing whether they have symptoms, or they can also intervene in some antiviral drugs.In principle, the isolation can be dismissed after detecting the nucleic acid of the specimen.What is the positive and double -positive of the new coronary pneumonic acid detection, and what is the difference between the two?According to Zhang Guojun, according to the ""New Coronatte Pneumonic Pneumonia Laboratory Detection Technology Guide (Fourth Edition)"", the detection method of the new coronary virus nucleic acid is mainly real-time fluorescence RT-PCR method.(Open Reading Frame 1AB, ORF1AB) and Nucleocapsid Protein (N).Under normal circumstances, the ORF1AB and N genes of positive patients are also positive at the same time, but there will also be an ORF1AB or N gene positive, which is called a single positive.The test of the new coronary virus nucleic acid is a single positive case, and it still needs to be sampled again for real-time fluorescence RT-PCR detection to determine whether it is positive for cases.O web link",real,checked

Many Chinese citizens have just arrived in Russia. There are no food reserves in their residences. How can I be isolated for 14 days?Some people were arrested for the current demand to go downstairs to purchase daily necessities. The ""Chalin Nuo Disabled Rehabilitation Center"" by the police to the ""Emperor Village"" was concentrated and forced.Original: Make -up knives to make up for writing: According to media reports, 80 Chinese citizens will be repatriated by Russia for violation of Russia's related regulations during the prevention and control of new crown pneumonia, and stipulate that they cannot enter the country within 5 years.Now the 80 people are still isolated at the Center for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled Persons in Chalin. Some Chinese citizens (including overseas students) appealed to the results of the judgment, but were rejected by the Moscow court in the second instance.Does Russia make sense to these Chinese citizens?Is not suitable?Through communication with some parties, the author believes that the following points are questionable and must be clarified.01 The ""Moscow Chief National Health Officer instructions"", which was ordered to be signed, did not regulate that my citizen was ordered by Russia to sign the ""Moscow Chief National Health Officer instructions"" when entering the country, but this instruction itself was not standardized, and Russia did not do it on its content.Detailed explanation.This document has only Russian version, and many of my citizens who enter the country are not proficient in Russian, and even do not understand Russian at all. Medical staff at Moscow Airport do not understand Chinese and English.Many Chinese citizens who enter the country take it for granted that this is just an ordinary routine health watch, so it is signed at the requesting signature.It is understood that only 10 of the 80 people who were repatriated said that they could understand Russian or understand the meaning of the signature documents.This has led most Chinese citizens when they were taken by the police to force isolation, and they did not know what happened, and they did not know that they would be deprived of their work or study visas and were repatriated and were not allowed to enter for 5 years.""Moscow's Chief National Health Officer instruction"" and ""Moscow Chief National Health Officer instructions"", the author read the ""Moscow Chief National Health Officer instruction"" and found that this is a very irregular document, or even the word ""virus"" of ""new crown virus"".The letter spelling error appeared (the sixth letter ""а"" was written as ""о"").There are such rough errors in a serious law, which makes people unimaginable.02 The ""Moscow Chief National Health Officer instructions"" stipulates that the provisions in the ""Moscow Chief National Health Officer instructions"" are not considering the actual situation of my entry citizen.The document stipulates that my entry citizen should be isolated in my own residence. We cannot go to the unit, school, store, pharmacy, and other public places. Public transportation cannot be used. Terrate body temperatures twice a day, and telephone to report health.But many Chinese citizens have just arrived in Russia. There are no food reserves in their residences. How can they be isolated for 14 days?Some people were arrested for the current demand to go downstairs to purchase daily necessities. The ""Chalin Nuo Disabled Rehabilitation Center"" by the police to the ""Emperor Village"" was concentrated and forced.Of course, Chalin Nuo Disabled Rehabilitation Center, Chalin Nuo Disabled Rehabilitation Center, of course, we do not deny that among these 80 people may have aware of the criminals and intentionally violated the municipal authorities of Moscow.Russia News Network pointed out on the 4th that among the 80 Chinese citizens who were repatriated to the country, several people were facing new criminal allegations. They were accused of violating Russia's laws and regulations on the 22nd and 22nd.In the middle, the medical mask is transported to illegally obtain huge profits, and is suspected of illegal use of huge cash and tax evasion.03 The trial procedure of the court repatriation of the court was not standardized. Because most people refused to sign the repatriation consent, the parties' signing session was canceled and changed to a direct video trial.According to the parties, there was only one judge and a translator at the video trial site.The whole process is only a few minutes, and the opportunity to defend the parties will not hire the parties.According to regulations, the judgment is not allowed to appeal within 10 days.However, many parties are still being separated and do not have sufficient conditions for appeal.It can only rely on the consular services and legal aid of my embassy.According to the provisions of the Moscow court judgment, if there is no appeal, the parties will face forced repatriation rather than leave by themselves, which means that after receiving the judgment, the parties need to wait for a period of time in a special shelter.Repatriation back to China.04 Epidemic prevention and prevention is the new crown virus instead of the Chinese, just like my embassy in Russia on February 24, the ""general monitoring of all personnel from China"" talked about the Moscow government on February 24.""Including the United States and other Western countries, any country in the world today has no special surveillance of Chinese citizens. In the face of the virus, the Chinese government understands the necessity of the Moscow government to take certain measures, but I hope that the measures in Moscow canIt is in line with the actual situation of preventing viruses and is not discriminatory. ""The Chinese Embassy in Russia gave the Moscow Municipal Government's according to the Chinese Embassy in Russia to the Moscow Municipal Government.The Chinese Embassy in Russia announced on March 1st that ""Temporary prevention measures that Russia needed to prevent and control the prevention and control of epidemic should be respected.""Citizens have also conducted epidemic prevention inspections, and the staff of the embassy was also asked when she went to the streets. According to the embassy, Moscow law enforcement personnel generally regulated law enforcement specifications and checked the passport to confirm that the entry time was more than 14 days later. ""On March 7, Moscow, Moscow, MoscowThe municipal government has issued new regulations that requiring people to visit Italy, South Korea, Iran, Germany, France, and Spain within two weeks must be separated from Russia.This once again proves that Russia is aimed at the new crown virus instead of which country citizens.However, during the prevention and control of the Russian epidemic, we also saw individual disadvantages of disadvantages of China -Russia friendship.""Chinese are not allowed to enter the inside.""A restaurant in Russia's Maccara City says ""Chinese people must not enter the inside."" A restaurant door in Russia, Russia, ""Chinese people must not enter the inside"".What is the difference between the infamous notice sign of the Bund Park?The relations between China and Russia have gone through the storms of 70 years.We often say that China and Russia under the framework of strategic collaboration partnerships have become ""a good neighbor that cannot be moved away, and the true partners who cannot dismantle them"" ""The diplomatic relationship between the country lies in the people of the people and the people's obedience lies in their hearts.""

His hometown is Lianyungang and a nurse in a private medical institution in Nanjing.At the beginning of the epidemic, she saw the news on the Internet and was in a heavy mood.She feels that as a medical staff, although it is not a national unit and there is no preparation, she should do her heart.On February 18, she saw the news of Wuhan's recruitment of volunteers on the Internet, and immediately replaced it and simply packed it. She went to Wuhan on the 19th.Because Jia Xiaoyue assisted Wuhan in his own name, he did not enjoy the treatment of any public medical staff. He took a car by himself, and finally bought a ticket to go home silently.There is no farewell, not even the words of gratitude.On April 2nd, Jia Xiaoyue, who fought with the illness for more than a month in Wuhan, finally completed his ""mission"". He bought a ticket herself and left the hero's city silently.After returning to Nanjing, she wasolated for 14 days and then returned to peace, as if nothing had happened.Friends in Wuhan said, ""The people of Hubei are sorry for Jia Xiaoyue. She has done so much for us, but we have not done anything, and we have no time to say goodbye and goodbye.""All the medical staff who fight on the front line are heroes in our hearts. Whether she is inside the system or outside the system, it should be respected and courteous.What I can do is minimalist, and I can only repost the sent by Mr. Chen Zhaopeng, Sina Weibo again. It is really touching. This is the most ordinary hero. We should remember her.Forward to show respect for heroes!Intersection",fake,checked

Before going out, spray the fines on the clothes.

"[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: #African American New Crown Mortality Rate 2.5 Times Whites#] According to US media reports, the new crown epidemic has killed more than 150,000 people in the United States. The relevant data also reflect the long-standing racial inequality in the United States from the side. According to statistics, the death rate of African Americans from new coronary pneumonia is 2.5 times that of whites. In this regard, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained that this is because African-Americans are more engaged in basic physical work and cannot have better economic and medical conditions, which makes African-Americans higher risk of infection and death than the white population. In addition, statistics show that among Americans aged 18 to 64, the number of African-American uninsured residents is more than twice that of whites. High medical costs force a large number of minorities to give up treatment. http://t.cn/A6U4cvXO",real,checked
